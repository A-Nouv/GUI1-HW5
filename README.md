# GUI1-HW5
I have not implemented everything for this assignment.
This project was to create a bit of a Scrabble game that had drag and drop
elements. The tiles are used to create words, each tile has a certain value which will then be calculated to determine the user's score. The board has special spots that will double an individual letter's score or double the word's total score.
